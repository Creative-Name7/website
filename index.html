      <div class="maintext"><h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
      <li>ADHD is a developmental disorder marked by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Some people have symptoms of inattention, others have symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, and some people can have both symptoms.</li>
      <h2>How do symptoms change over time?</h2>
      <li>Children show hyperactivity and impulsivity as the most common symptoms. As academic and social demands increase, symptoms of inattention often become more prominent and begin to interfere with academic performance and peer relationships.</li>
      <li>Adolescents usually show less hyperactivity and may appear as restless or fidgeting. Symptoms of inattention and impulsivity typically continue and may cause academic, organizational, or relationship challenges. Teens with ADHD are more likely to engage in impulsive, risky behaviors, such as substance use and unsafe sexual activity.</li>
      <li>Adults, including older adults, can show inattention, restlessness, and impulsivity, although, in some people, those symptoms become less severe and less impairing. They may also be irritable, have a low tolerance for frustration and stress, or experience frequent or intense mood changes.</li>
      <h2>What kinds of treatment are there?</h2>
      <li>Stimulants are the most common type of medication used to treat ADHD, and research shows them to be highly effective. They work by increasing levels of brain chemicals involved in thinking and attention. Like all medications, stimulants can have side effects and must be prescribed and monitored by a health care provider.</li>
      <li>Psychological interventions for ADHD can take many forms and be combined with medication and other elements for parents, families, and teachers. Adding therapy to an ADHD treatment plan can help some people better cope with daily challenges, gain confidence, or manage impulsive and risky behaviors.</li>
      <h2 class="stigmaTitle">Stigmas</h2>
      <h3>There are a few types of stigmas associated with ADHD: Self-Stigma, "Not real" Stigma, and medication stigma.</h3>
      <li>Self-Stigma: People with ADHD might internalize negative societal attitudes from others, they might feel guilty, embarrassed, or flawed, leading to low self-esteem and in some cases depression or other mental health issues.</li>
      <li>"Not real" Stigma: Some people might believe that ADHD is not a real medical condition, leading to them thinking people with ADHD use it as an excuse for their laziness or lack of motivation.</li>
      <li>Medication Stigma: There is some skepticism around the use of medication for ADHD which can lead to people avoiding treatment.</li></div>
